# Math Lecture Notes
This is a collection of my typed-up math lecture notes taken during my undergrad at *Pasadena City College* and *University of California Los Angeles*. Note that mistakes/typos are often inevitable, and they are all my responsibility, so please be aware of that when referencing these notes. Also, keep in mind that this is not a completed list as you may see I still haven't graduated from UCLA yet, so I will update this repository very regularly as I take more courses in the near future. Some of the courses information can be found through the tables below.
